## Usage

VBA Challenge analyzes stocks performance over several years, providing yearly change of each stock ticker,
and percentage change, and total annual volume also. Additionally it reads out the ticker with the greatest increase and decrease and the greatest annual total stock volume. It is conditionally formatted to show red when a value is negative for yearly change and percentage change, and green when those values are positive.

My classmate Jacqueline Meyer helped with figuring out how to code the open price value, and the code for getting down the bottom of column: LastRow=ws.Cells(Rows.Count,1).End(xlUp).Row

Mark Fulton, a tutor, helped me get the greatest increase and decrease code figured out and working also.
